# Tic-Tac-Toe
```"Zero Kata"```

In this Game I have used c++ language 
I have used 2D Character Arrrays for creating the matrix and have initilized with alphabets so when the game starts the user needs to enter the alphabet for the position and his/her choice will be putted there i  am traversing whole array for doing this first searching for the letter and when its found udating the position the 'O' or 'X' as per the choice there are two methods check and show_updated as the name suggests check will check for each column and row who is winning and show udapted will show the updated matrix placing 'O' or 'X' at its desirable position
